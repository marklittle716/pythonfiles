# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. In Python, we do not use parentheses and curly brackets, we use indentation with tabs or spaces



# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. Very similar to JS arrow functions

#fun with functions

num1 = input('enter a number ')
num2 = input('enter a second number ')

sum = int(num1) + int(num2)

if sum <= 30:
    print('The total is less than or equal to 30')
else:

    print(sum)
